Newznab-tmux dashboard, based upon free Charisma bootstrap theme

    Based off original work titled 'Charisma' by Muhammad Usman
    Original Charisma license in doc/charisma-license.txt


NewzDash is a Dashboard application built for the newznab-tmux/nZEDb indexing software (https://github.com/DariusIII/newznab-tmux / https://github.com/nZEDb/nZEDb)

Installation Instructions

- Configure apache or nginx to serve newzdash at port of your choice. I prefer it configured as a subdomain on your host (ie. something.yourhost.whatever)
- Access NewzDash via your browser at http://hostname:port
- The first time you bring up NewzDash, it will redirect you to the configuration page.
- You need to specify the directy where Newznab-tmux is installed so that NewzDash can find the Newznab-tmux/nZEDb config.php file

Newznab-tmux/nZEDb version is based on https://github.com/tssgery/newzdash.
